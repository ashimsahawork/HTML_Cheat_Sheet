# Important points:

# HTML Tag:
    - Element names are surrounded by angle brackets. | Example: <div>, <span>, etc.
    - Tags normally come in pairs (Start tag and end tag). | Example: <h1>Welcome</h1>
    - End tag is usually the same but with a forward slash. | Example: </div>, </h1>, etc.
    - Some tags close themselves. | Example: <br>, <hr>

# HTML page structure:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        
    </body>
    </html>
